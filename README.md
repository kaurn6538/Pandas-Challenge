## Pandas-Challenge
## Part 1 - Local Government Area (LGA) Summary
This repository contains the code to perform necessary calculations and create a high-level snapshot of the local government area's key metrics for all students and schools within an LGA.

## The following metrics are included:

1.Total number of unique schools
2.Total number of students
3.Total budget
4.Average math’s score
5.Average reading score
6.% passing math’s (the percentage of students who passed math’s)
7.% passing reading (the percentage of students who passed reading)
8.% overall passing (the percentage of students who passed math’s AND reading)
## Data Source
The data for this analysis comes from a dataset of student and school information. The dataset includes information on each student's math and reading scores, as well as information on each school's budget and location. The data set can be found in this repository under PyCitySchools/Resources.

## Getting Started
To run the analysis, clone this repository and run the PyCitySchools_AnalysisCode-Final.ipynb notebook within the PyCitySchools folder. The notebook contains the necessary code to read in the data, perform the calculations, and create the summary DataFrame.

## Requirements
The analysis requires the following libraries:

1.pandas
2.numpy

## Part 2 - School Summary and Analysis
This repository contains the code to perform necessary calculations and create DataFrames that summaries key metrics about each school and their student's performance.

## Data Source
The data for this analysis comes from a dataset of student and school information. The dataset includes information on each student's math and reading scores, as well as information on each school's budget and location. The data set can be found in this repository under PyCitySchools/Resources.

## Getting Started
To run the analysis, clone this repository and run the PyCitySchool_Analysis_AG.ipynb notebook. The notebook contains the necessary code to read in the data, perform the calculations, and create the summary DataFrames.

## Requirements
The analysis requires the following libraries:

1.pandas
2.numpy

## Results
The analysis produces the following DataFrames:

The School Summary is a DataFrame that summarizes key metrics for each school, including the school's name, type, number of students, school budget, per student budget, average math and reading scores, and the percentage of students passing math, reading, and overall.
Top-Performing Schools: A DataFrame of the top 5 performing schools, sorted by % overall passing.
Bottom-Performing Schools: A DataFrame of the bottom 5 performing schools, sorted by % overall passing.
Math Scores by Year: A DataFrame that lists the average math score for students of each year level (9, 10, 11, 12) at each school.
Reading Scores by Year: A DataFrame that lists the average reading score for students of each year level (9, 10, 11, 12) at each school.
Scores by School Spending: A table that breaks down school performance based on average spending ranges (per student), including the average math, and reading scores, students passing math, passing reading, and passing overall.
Scores by School Size: A table that breaks down school performance based on total students, including the average math, and reading scores, percentage of students passing math, passing reading, and passing overall.
Scores by School Type: A table that breaks down school performance based on total students, including the average math, and reading scores, percentage of students passing math, passing reading, and passing overall.

## Analysis Findings
The repository also contains a PDF file titles "PyCitySchools_Findings" that highlights the findings and conclusions that can be drawn from our analysis.


#Happy analyzing!
