# Pandas-Challenge
# District School Data Analysis 
This repository contains code for analyzing district school data. It utilizes the pandas library in Python to import, manipulate, and analyze the data. The following tasks were performed in this project:
1. Importing data and basic data exploration using pandas. 
2. Imported necessary libraries and the dataset. 
3. Used the len function to calculate the total number of schools and students. 
4. Calculating average scores in math and reading using the mean function in pandas.
5. Created a dataframe from the results. 
6. Calculated the average scores in math and reading. 
7. Filtering students who passed math and reading. 
8. Created separate filtered options to get the students who passed math and reading.
9. Calculating pass rates. 
10. Calculated the percentage of students who passed math and reading. 
11. Sorting schools by overall rating. 
12. Used the sort function to sort schools based on overall rating in ascending and descending order. 
13. Analyzing scores by grade. 
14. Calculated the math and reading scores by grade.
15. Categorizing spending.
16. Used the cut function to categorize spending into different ranges.
17. Conclusions.
    • Found that schools with higher budgets did not yield better test results.
    • Smaller and medium-sized schools outperformed larger-sized schools in passing math performances.
    • Charter schools generally outperformed public district schools across all metrics. Please refer to the code files for more details on each task and the specific data used for analysis.
# Prerequisites To run the code in this project, you need the following dependencies: 
• Python (version 3.0 or higher) 
• Pandas library 
• NumPy library (if not already installed with pandas) 
# Please ensure that you have these dependencies installed before running the code. 
# Usage 
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Open the code files using a Python IDE or text editor.
4. Install the necessary dependencies if not already installed.
5. Run the code to perform the analysis and generate the results.
 Feel free to modify the code or dataset as per your needs and explore further insights from the district school data.
